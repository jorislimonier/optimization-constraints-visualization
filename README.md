# Visualisation of constraint regions

This program helps visualizing feasible regions.
Simply add you constraints and it will do the rest for you.

This could be much improved and contributions are welcome. If you feel like helping out, here are a couple suggestions (non-exhaustive list)

## TODO:
- 2D
    - Find a way to display constraint lines without requiring second implementation of constraints by user (possibly using sympy).
    - More advanced: Figure out where the feasible region is so that user doesn't have to enter axes min and max
- 3D
    - Simplify triple loop by introducing matrices or meshgrid.
    - Figure out what 'alphahull' parameter actually does.
    - Make 3D Visualization prettier.
